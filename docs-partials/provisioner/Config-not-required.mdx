- `host_alias` (string) - The alias by which the host should be known.
  Defaults to `default`.

- `user` (string) - The `user` set for your communicator. Defaults to the `user` set
  by packer.

- `local_port` (uint) - The port on which to attempt to listen for SSH
   connections. This value is a starting point. The provisioner will attempt
   listen for SSH connections on the first available of ten ports, starting at
   `local_port`. A system-chosen port is used when `local_port` is missing or
   empty.

- `ssh_host_key_file` (string) - The SSH key that will be used to run the SSH
   server on the host machine to forward commands to the target machine.
   packer connects to this server and will validate the identity of the
   server using the system known_hosts. The default behavior is to generate
   and use a onetime key.

- `ssh_authorized_key_file` (string) - The SSH public key of the packer `ssh_user`.
  The default behavior is to generate and use a onetime key.

- `use_sftp` (bool) - packer's SFTP proxy is not reliable on some unix/linux systems,
  therefore we recommend to use scp as default for packer proxy

- `debug` (bool) - Sets the log level to `DEBUG`

- `asset_name` (string) - The asset name passed to Mondoo Platform. Defaults to the hostname
  of the instance.

- `on_failure` (string) - Configure behavior whether packer should fail if `scan_threshold` is
  not met. If `scan_threshold` configuration is omitted, the threshold
  is set to `0` and builds will pass regardless of what score is
  returned.
  If `score_threshold` is set to a value, and `on_failure = "continue"`
  builds will continue regardless of what score is returned.

- `labels` (map[string]string) - Configure an optional map of labels for the asset data.

- `annotations` (map[string]string) - Configure an optional map of `key/val` annotations for the asset data in
  Mondoo Platform.

- `incognito` (bool) - Configures incognito mode. Defaults to `true`. When set to false, scan results
  will not be sent to Mondoo Platform.

- `policies` ([]string) - A list of policies to be executed (requires incognito mode).

- `policybundle` (string) - A path to local policy bundle file.

- `sudo` (\*SudoConfig) - Run mondoo scan with `--sudo`. Defaults to none.

- `winrm_user` (string) - Configure WinRM user. Defaults to `user` set by the packer communicator.

- `winrm_password` (string) - Configure WinRM user password. Defaults to `password` set by the packer communicator.

- `use_proxy` (bool) - Use proxy to connect to host to scan. This configuration will fall-back to packer proxy
  for cases where the provisioner cannot access the target directly
  NOTE: we have seen cases with the vsphere builder

- `output` (string) - Set output format: summary, full, yaml, json, csv, compact, report, junit (default "compact")

- `score_threshold` (int) - An integer value to set the `score_threshold` of mondoo scans. Defaults to `0` which results in
  a passing score regardless of what scan results are returned.

- `mondoo_config_path` (string) - The path to the mondoo client config. Defaults to `$HOME/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml`
