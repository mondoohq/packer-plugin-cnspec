# Mondoo Provisioner (DEPRECATED)

Type: `mondoo`

>This plugin has been deprecated. Migrate to [Packer plugin cnspec by Mondoo](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/provisioners/mondoo/cnspec) for even easier security scanning of your Packer builds.

The `mondoo` provisioner scans [Packer](https://www.packer.io) builds for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations by executing security
policies-as-code enabled in [Mondoo Platform](https://console.mondoo.com). Mondoo Platform comes stocked with an ever-increasing collection of
certified security policies which can be easily customize to meet your needs.

Mondoo supports scanning of Linux, Windows, and macOS, as well as Docker containers.

## Basic Example
```hcl
  provisioner "mondoo" {
    on_failure          = "continue"
    mondoo_config_path  = "/etc/mondoo-config.json"
    score_threshold     = 85
    asset_name          = "example-secure-base-image"
    sudo {
      active = true
    }

    annotations = {
      Source_AMI    = "{{ .SourceAMI }}"
      Creation_Date = "{{ .SourceAMICreationDate }}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Optional Parameters:
@include '/provisioner/Config-not-required.mdx'

### SudoConfig
@include '/provisioner/SudoConfig-not-required.mdx'
