## Plugin Installation

### Using the packer init command
Starting from version 1.7, Packer supports a new `packer init` command allowing automatic installation of Packer plugins. Read the [Packer documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init) for more information.

To install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration . Then, run `packer init`.

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    mondoo = {
      version = ">= 0.4.0"
      source  = "github.com/mondoohq/mondoo"
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual installation

You can find pre-built binary releases of the plugin [here](https://github.com/mondoohq/packer-plugin-mondoo/releases).

Once you have downloaded the latest archive corresponding to your target OS, uncompress it to retrieve the plugin binary file corresponding to your platform. To install the plugin, please follow the Packer documentation on
[installing a plugin](https://www.packer.io/docs/extending/plugins/#installing-plugins).

### Build from source
